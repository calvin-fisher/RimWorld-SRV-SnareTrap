  <description>
Simple snare for trapping wild animals with low intelligence.

The trap snares and suffocates small animals, can briefly restrain larger ones. Effectiveness scales with difficulty. 

Taken from CuproPanda's Survivalist's Additions, re-balanced, and packaged as a stand-alone mod.

Should be backwards-compatibile with games saved with the full mod. Just uninstall Survivalist's Additions, install this mod, and you no longer have a dependency on all the other pieces.
